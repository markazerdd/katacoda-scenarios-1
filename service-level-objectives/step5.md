# Modeling failure in our systems

Let's start introducing errors by switching images! This will allow us to explore what happens to our SLO's status and error budget. 
 
In a real world scenario, a popular e-commerce site will receive a lot of traffic and there is eventually going to be some errors introduced in the application for various reasons. For now we are dealing with our hypothetical web store. 

After you're done, close all storedog tabs that you have open in your browser.
 
In the first terminal window where you currently have docker-compose running, press CTRL + C to stop the command. Wait 10 to 15 seconds until docker-compose gracefully stops and you regain the ability to type commands in the terminal window.

Now enter a new docker-compose command using the broken image like so:

<pre data-target="clipboard">
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-files/docker-compose-broken-instrumented.yml up
</pre>

Wait a few minutes until the application has fully started again.
 
Try going back to the storedog homepage, selecting a product and adding it to your cart. What happens when you do this? You should be getting a NoMethodExists error. In the real world this could have been any error that causes the add item request to fail. Press the back button in your browser and try adding other items to your cart to purposely induce more errors.
 
Go back to the SLO details page. What do you see now? Your SLO status and error budget should no longer be 100% anymore .

Try hovering over the different colored bars in the bar graph and you'll be able to see a count of good and bad events that occurred at a given time:

Over time if these errors were to continue at a high pace, our error budget would quickly deplete and we might be at risk of breaching our Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with customers. By being diligent with creating and managing SLOs for critical user journeys we can uncover user experience issues and take action to resolve them quickly to reduce their impact!
